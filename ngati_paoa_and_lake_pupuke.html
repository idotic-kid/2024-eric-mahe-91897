                        Ngāti Pāoa

                        <b>Ngāti Pāoa</b> is a Māori iwi of the Hauraki region. Its traditional lands stretch from the western side of the Hauraki Plains to Auckland. They also settled on Hauraki Gulf islands such as Waiheke.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ngāti Pāoa is one of five tribes of the Marutūāhu confederation, the others being Ngāti Maru, Ngāti Rongoū, Ngāti Tamaterā and Ngāti Whanaunga. The Marutūāhu tribes are all descended from Marutūāhu, a son of Hotunui, who is said to have arrived in New Zealand on the Tainui canoe. The Marutūāhu tribes are therefore part of the Tainui group of tribes. The Marutūāhu confederation is also part of the Hauraki collective of tribes.

                    <h2>
                        Early history
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Ngāti Pāoa is descended from Pāoa. According to a Hauraki tradition his father was Rongo-tiu-moe-whara of the East Coast iwi, Ngāti Kahungunu, born at Whai-a-pāoa near Wharekahika. According to Tainui accounts his father was Hekemaru, his paternal grandparents were Pikiao from the Te Arawa tribe, and Rereiao, a high-born Waikato woman descended from Whatihua, and he was the brother of Mahuta, from whom Ngāti Mahuta is descended. On either version, Pāoa lived with his first wife Tauhākari, sons Toapoto and Toawhana, and daughter Koura at Kaitotehe, near Taupiri in the central Waikato. Pāoa moved from Kaitotehe to Hauraki, where he married Tukutuku, a granddaughter of Tamaterā, with whom he had sons, first Haora Tipa Koinaki and second Horowhenua.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pāoa and Tukutuku's children lived in and around the Hauraki Plains. Ngāti Pāoa later spread to the western side of the Firth of Thames, from where they also frequented the Hunua Ranges. By the 1700s they also frequented the Tāmaki (Auckland) isthmus, the North Shore and the eastern and northern Coromandel Peninsula.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In about 1780 Ngāti Pāoa established settlements along the western side of the Tamaki River and at Mokoia (present-day Panmure). In 1790 and from 1793 to 1798 they engaged in many battles with tribes to the north, at least as far as the Mahurangi district. By 1805 they were tiring of war and negotiated peace settlements with many neighbouring tribes. At this time they had settlements along the Tamaki River as far as Otahuhu.
